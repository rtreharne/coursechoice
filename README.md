# COURSE CHOICE APP

## IDEA

Introducing the Course Choice App: Empowering Higher Education (HE) students and staff with a dynamic tool for academic exploration!

Imagine a world where students have the freedom to curate their own learning journey, handpicking courses that align with their passions and aspirations. With our publicly available tool, this dream becomes a reality.

Not only does the Course Choice App allow students to select courses on their programme, but it also provides a unique opportunity for staff to input module information. From pre-requisites to data on popularity, this comprehensive platform equips educators with the tools they need to enhance the learning experience.

But that's not all! Inspired by the "people who bought this also bought" feature on Amazon, our app goes the extra mile. It suggests additional courses based on the choices of fellow students, fostering a sense of community and collaboration.

And what's a modern tool without a touch of interactivity? The Course Choice App incorporates a rating and review system, empowering students to share their thoughts and experiences. This valuable feedback not only helps future students make informed decisions but also encourages continuous improvement within the academic community.

Join us on this exciting journey as we revolutionize course selection in Higher Education. The Course Choice App is here to empower, inspire, and transform the way we learn!
